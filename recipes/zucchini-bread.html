        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This zucchini bread recipe is wonderfully moist, and sweet with lots of zucchini. Top it off with some butter and you'll have yourself a delicious and easy breakfast.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 cups grated zucchini - lightly packed</li>
            <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1/4 cup packed light brown sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce</li>
            <li>1/3 cup vegetable oil</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups all purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Spray a 9x5 inch loaf pan with cooking spray.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, add the grated zucchini, sugar, brown sugar, applesauce, oil, eggs, and vanilla. Whisk until well combined.</li>
            <li>Add the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon. Stir just until no dry flour retains, trying not to over mix.</li>
            <li>Pour the batter into the loaf pan. Bake for 50 to 54 minutes. A toothpick inserted into the centre of the bread should come out with moist crumbs on it.</li>
            <li>Cool in the pan for 10 minutes. Remove from the pan and transfer to a wire cooling rack to cool completely before slicing.</li>
            <li>Store covered in the refrigerator.</li>
        </ol>
