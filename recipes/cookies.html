        <p>These cookies are rich, and buttery and will be sure to please!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup European-Style salted butter, room temperature</li>
            <li>8 oz cream cheese, room temperature</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon almond extract</li>
            <li>2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/4 cup powdered sugar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.</li>
            <li>In a stand mixer, beat together butter, cream cheese, and granulated sugar until smooth.</li>
            <li>With the mixer running, add in the egg and then the almond extract.</li>
            <li>In a separate bowl, stir together the flour, baking powder, and 1/4 cup of powdered sugar.</li>
            <li>With the mixer on low, slowly add the dry flour mixture to the already creamed mixture.</li>
            <li>Once smooth, remove the bowl from the mixer and cover. Place in the refrigerator for 30 minutes to chill.</li>
            <li>Line a large sheet pan with nonstick parchment paper. Place extra powdered sugar (for rolling) in a shallow bowl.</li>
            <li>Once chilled, use a 2 tablespoons cookie scoop to create cookie dough ball, immediately rolling fully in powdered sugar.</li>
            <li>Place on the baking sheet, 6 at a time, and bake for 10-11 minutes. When they are no longer wet on top and are firm o the sides, they are done. We prefer them on the shorter cook time so they are extra gooey!</li>
            <li>Allow to cool o the sheet pan for 5 minutes, and then place on a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
        </ol>
